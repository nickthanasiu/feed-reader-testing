# Project Overview

This project was completed for Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program. I was provided with a simple web-app, for which I was to write a series of test suites with Jasmine.

The app uses the Google Feed Reader API to grab RSS feeds as JSON objects.

My test suites tested for the following: 

###
  *Do the Feed objects have the appropriate properties (name, url)?
  *Is the navigation menu hidden upon loading the page?
  *Does the menu's visibility toggle when hamburger menu icon is clicked?
  *Does the default feed contain any entries upon loading the page?
  *Does new content load when a different feed is selected?
      
  
Original instructions are included in the comments inside jasmine/spec/feedreader.js
